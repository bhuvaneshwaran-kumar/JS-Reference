# Hooks.

## What and why react hooks.

with hooks you can manage state in func components.

- lot of code is optimized .

# useState :

useState() is a hook that lets you add react state to functional component.

# useRef :

useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

# Lifting State Up.

    we can also able to pass methods that actually manupulate the state as a prop.
    now if the state got updated by child component the changes will be synchronized in all the components which uses the state.
