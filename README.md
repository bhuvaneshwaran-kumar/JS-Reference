# React 18 Alpha

## How to install

**npm install react@alpha react-dom@alpha --force**

You can use the --force flag so that you can update both react and react-dom libraries:

### The notable features you can already try in React 18 are as follows:

- The new ReactDOM.createRoot() API replacing ReactDOM.render()
- Batching improvements for fewer renders
- SSR support for <Suspense> component
- startTransition API for non-urgent state updates

---

## ReactDOM.createRoot() API explained

The ReactDOM.createRoot() method replaces the ReactDOM.render()

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
const container = document.getElementById("root");
// Create a root.
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
// Render the top component to the root.
root.render(<App />);
```

> Note : You can try React 18 features only after you use the createRoot() method.

## Automatic batching improvements for rendering

**Batching** is mechanism used by React to group multiple state updates into one re-render. With batching, you will avoid unnecessary renders and optimize the rendering process

However, the batching mechanism implemented in React 17 was not consistent. The batching wonâ€™t happen when you call the state update methods from a callback.

**React 18** solved the problem above by improving the batching mechanism.
